# Exercise 3: Create a new string made of the first, middle, and last characters of each input string
# Given two strings, s1 and s2, write a program to return a new string made of s1 and s2â€™s first, middle, and last characters.

# Given:

# s1 = "America"
# s2 = "Japan"

# Expected Output:

# AJrpan

s1 = "America"
s2 = "Japan"
resultString:str = s1[0] + s2[0] + s1[(len(s1)//2)] + s2[len(s2)//2] + s1[-1] + s2[-1]
print(resultString)
